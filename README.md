# Introduction
Many people want healthier food options, but they often face three barriers: lack of time, lack of affordable options, and a belief that healthy food is not the best tasting. Our main question for this project is, how can we help people make lower-calorie food choices without sacrificing convenience and taste?

# Requirements
1. Time-efficient and user-friendly
2. Simple recipes
3. Affordable and common ingredients
4. Clear nutritional information, such as calorie content.
5. Flavorful

# Specifications
1. The user must be able to compare food options based on clear nutritional information, such as calories and nutritional content.
2. The user should be able to find their desired recipe in 2 minutes or less.

# Solution
We are building a social app that allows users to swipe through low-calorie, gluten-free, organic meals. They are able to like their favorite recipe and keep it safe in their profile. They are also able to upload their own recipes and show off their own creations. The app is fast and fun – a Tinder-style app, but instead of matching with dates, you'll be matching with your favorite recipe to try!

# Features
- Swipe Recipes: Users can swipe right or left on a recipe to browse new meals. 
- Favorites: Save liked recipes to their favorites page.
- Tag Filters: Uses tags like "Organic", "Low-calorie", "Gluten Free" to filter through recipes.
- Nutrition Breakdown: Each recipe clearly displays calories, ingredients, prep-time, and instructions
- Add Your Own: Users can add their own recipes and upload their own images.
